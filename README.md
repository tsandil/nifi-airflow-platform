My learning project to understand how Airflow and NiFi work together on Kubernetes.

## What I'm Building

A local Kubernetes cluster running:
- Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration)
- Apache NiFi (data flow)

## Current Status

**In Progress** - Setting up local development environment

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Understand Kubernetes operators
- [ ] Deploy services with Helm
- [ ] Debug pod issues
- [ ] Network communication between services

## Setup (Coming Soon)

Will document as I build this.
